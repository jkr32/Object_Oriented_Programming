# Object-Oriented-Programing

School Project I did for my Object Oriented class. Written in JavaSwing using MVC methods.

When you run the project file it will prompt you to input the file name 
in which you would like to use. My .txt file is included and named inputData.txt. 
On my computer I have to use the entire file extension so you might have to do that as well.
